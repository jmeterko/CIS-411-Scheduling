SELECT ID, NAME, CURRENT, Last_Term, Total, GPA, EagleMail_ID
FROM `student`
WHERE ID IN
	(SELECT ID FROM `studentclass`
     WHERE `Subject` = 'CIS'
     AND Catalog BETWEEN 200 AND 299);

Select all students with a Location of Clarion:

SELECT ID, NAME, CURRENT,Last_Term, Total, GPA, EagleMail_ID  FROM `student` WHERE LOCATION = 'CLARION';

Select all students who have taken CIS 217:

SELECT ID, NAME, CURRENT,Last_Term, Total, GPA, EagleMail_ID

     WHERE `Subject` = 'CIS'
     AND Catalog = '217');

    Need to add the Grade column into the import of Students-Classes
